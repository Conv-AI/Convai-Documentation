# Moves To

{% hint style="info" %}
By default, Convai Characters possess knowledge about the presence of other Convai characters within their environment.
{% endhint %}

### 1. Use Moves to with other Convai Characters present in the Environment.&#x20;

Let's assume there are two Convai characters present in the virtual environment. We can ask one of the characters to move to the other character as shown here.&#x20;
