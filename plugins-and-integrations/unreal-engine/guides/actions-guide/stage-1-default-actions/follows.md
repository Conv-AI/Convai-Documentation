* Then you start moving around and you will find that the Convai Character starts following you.&#x20;

### 2. Use follows with other characters/objects present in the Environment.&#x20;

* Add a reference to the object or character as shown in this [guide.](moves-to.md#2.-use-moves-to-with-other-objects-present-in-environment.)&#x20;
* Ask the character to follow the added character/object present in the Environment.&#x20;

* Even if we change the position of the object (cube here)  the Convai Character would still follow the cube.&#x20;
