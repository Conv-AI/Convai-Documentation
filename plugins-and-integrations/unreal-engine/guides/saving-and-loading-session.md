# Saving and Loading Session

### Introduction

This guide explains how to save and load the Session ID using Unreal Engine's SaveGame system. The steps are implemented in the **ConvaiBaseCharacter Blueprint.** By following this guide, you'll be able to store and retrieve Session IDs seamlessly in your project.

### Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following:

* Basic knowledge of Unreal Engine Blueprints.
* Familiarity with the SaveGame system in Unreal Engine.

### Step 1: Create the SaveGame Blueprint

To save the Session ID, you need to create a SaveGame Blueprint that will store the data.

1. **Open the Content Browser:**\
   Go to the Content Browser in Unreal Engine.
2. **Create a SaveGame Blueprint Class:**
   * Right-click in the Content Browser.
   * Select: **Blueprint Class > Search for `SaveGame` > Choose SaveGame**.
   * Name the new Blueprint `BP_ConvaiSave` (you can name it whatever you like, but ensure consistency in your Blueprint references).
3. **Add a Variable to Store Session ID:**
   * Open the `BP_ConvaiSave` Blueprint.
   * In the Variables panel, click **+** to create a new variable.
   * Configure the variable as follows:
     * **Name:** `SessionID`
     * **Type:** `String`
   * Compile and save the Blueprint.

Your SaveGame object is now ready to store the Session ID.

### Step 2: Saving the Session ID

In the **On Finished Talking** event of the **ConvaiBaseCharacter Blueprint**, implement the following steps to save the Session ID:

1. **Create Save Game Object:**
   * Add the `Create Save Game Object` node.
   * Select `BP_ConvaiSave` as the class.
2. **Set Session ID:**
   * Use the `Set SessionID` node to assign the Session ID from the Convai Chatbot to the SaveGame object.
3. **Save Game to Slot:**
   * Use the `Save Game to Slot` node to save the SaveGame object to a slot named `"Session"` (you can choose any slot name, but remember to use the same name when loading the saved data).
   * Use a `Branch` node to check if the operation was successful.

### Step 3: Loading the Session ID

In the **Begin Play** event of the **ConvaiBaseCharacter Blueprint**, implement the following steps to load the Session ID:

1. **Check if Save Exists:**
   * Use the `Does Save Game Exist` node to check if a save file exists in the `"Session"` slot.
2. **Load Save Game from Slot:**
   * If a save exists, use the `Load Game from Slot` node to load the SaveGame object.
3. **Cast to BP\_ConvaiSave:**
   * Use the `Cast to BP_ConvaiSave` node to access the `SessionID` variable in the SaveGame object.
4.  **Set Session ID:**

    * Assign the loaded `SessionID` back to the Convai Chatbot.

### Key Blueprint Nodes Used

* **Create Save Game Object:** Creates the SaveGame instance for storing data.
* **Set SessionID:** Assigns the Session ID to the SaveGame object.
* **Save Game to Slot:** Saves the created instance to disk.
* **Does Save Game Exist:** Checks if a save file exists in the specified slot.
* **Load Game from Slot:** Loads the saved data from disk.
* **Cast to BP\_ConvaiSave:** Accesses the stored data in the SaveGame object.

### Conclusion

By following this guide, you now have a functional system for saving and loading Session IDs in your project using Unreal Engineâ€™s SaveGame system. This implementation focuses on storing data locally, but you can expand it to include server-side storage or custom file handling if needed.
