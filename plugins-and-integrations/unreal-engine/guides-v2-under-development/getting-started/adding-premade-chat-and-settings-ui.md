# Adding Premade Chat and Settings UI

The goal of this guide is to easily show how to add a premade chat and settings widget to the UI by re-parenting the player blueprint, we will continue on the progress from the [Simple Talking Cube](simple-talking-cube.md) guide.

{% hint style="info" %}
It is recommended to remove the Convai Player component from the player blueprint that was created in the previous guide before proceeding with this guide.

1. (Optional) If you do not have a player blueprint already, then you can import a first person or third person content into your already existing project.
   1. From the Content Browser, click the Add button, then `Add feature or content pack to the project` then choose either `First Person` or `Third Person` then click `Add to Project`.\

      ![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/pasted image 0 (1).png>)
   2. Click the Window menu and make sure `World Settings` is enabled.\
      ![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (329).png>)
   3. On the `World Settings` tab, Find `GameMode Override` and set it to `BP_FirstPersonGameMode` for first person or `BP_thirdPersonGameMode` if you imported third person content.\
      ![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (331).png>)\

2. In the content browser, navigate to your player blueprint, which is by default at `FirstPerson/Blueprint/BP_FirstPersonCharacter` for First Person or `ThirdPerson/Blueprint/BP_ThirdPersonCharacter` which is the default for Third Person.
3. Open the blueprint and click `Class Settings` then in the `Details` section Under `Class Options` change the parent class to `ConvaiBasePlayer`.

{% hint style="info" %}
For advanced use cases, you may not want to change the parent class of the player blueprint, in that case we encourage you to use the `Convai Base Player` Blueprint itself as reference to see how to add the Chat and Settings widget or even create your own widgets from scratch.\
\
We expect developers who are looking to implement everything from scratch or do customization to be advanced enough to navigate the blueprints on their own.
