### Limitations of WebGL

#### Size Constraints

iOS browsers impose strict limitations on the size of WebGL builds. These constraints are primarily due to:

* Memory Limits: iOS devices have limited available memory for web applications, which can affect the performance and feasibility of running large WebGL builds.
* Browser Storage Quotas: Safari and other iOS browsers restrict the amount of data that can be stored locally. This includes caching and IndexedDB, which are often used to store assets for WebGL builds.

#### Key Limitations

* Maximum Downloadable Asset Size: iOS browsers may restrict the size of individual downloadable assets. Large assets might fail to load, causing the application to break.
* Total Build Size: The total size of all assets combined should ideally be kept under 50-100 MB for smooth performance. Exceeding this limit can lead to crashes or extremely slow loading times.
* Memory Usage: iOS devices typically have less RAM available compared to desktop environments. High memory usage by WebGL builds can result in frequent browser crashes.

#### Browser Compatibility

* Safari: The default browser on iOS, Safari, is generally the best option for WebGL builds, but it still has significant limitations compared to desktop browsers.
* Third-Party Browsers: Other browsers like Chrome or Firefox on iOS use the WebKit engine due to Appleâ€™s restrictions. Therefore, they inherit the same limitations as Safari.
