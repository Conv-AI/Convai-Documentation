# macOS Permission Issues

## Allowing the grpc\_csharp\_ext.bundle dll file in macOS

Using external DLLs in Unity on MacOS can lead to security permission issues due to Apple's strict security measures. Here's a step-by-step guide to resolving this common problem.

1.  **Verify the Problem**:

2.  **Manually Allow Blocked DLLs**:

    * Open System Preferences on your Mac.
    * Navigate to "Security & Privacy".

    * Under the "Security" tab, you might see a message at the bottom about the DLL being blocked. Click "Allow Anyway" or "Open Anyway" and enter password if asked.

3. **Modify Gatekeeper settings**: MacOS's Gatekeeper can prevent unidentified developers' software from running. To allow the DLL:
   * Open the Terminal (found in Applications > Utilities).
   * Type `sudo spctl --master-disable` and press Enter.
   * This command will allow apps to be downloaded from anywhere.
   * Now, try running the Unity project again.
   * After you're done, you should re-enable Gatekeeper with `sudo spctl --master-enable`  to avoid any malware.
4. **Check File Permissions**: Ensure the DLL has the correct file permissions.
   * In Finder, right-click (or control-click) on the DLL file and choose "Get Info".
   * Under “Sharing & Permissions”, ensure that your user account has "Read & Write" permissions.
5. **Review Unity's Plugin Settings**:
   * In the Unity editor, select the DLL in the Project view.
   * In the Inspector window, make sure the appropriate platform (in this case, Mac OS X) and architecture (Apple Silicon, Intel-64) is selected for the DLL.
   * Ensure that the "Load on Startup" and other pertinent options are checked (should be enabled by default)
