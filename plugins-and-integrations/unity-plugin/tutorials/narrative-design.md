# Narrative Design

This Unity tutorial shows you how to add a Convai-powered Tour Guide character for your 3D virtual environments. Convaiâ€™s Narrative Design Feature lets creators add spatial anchors in the 3D environment which guides the 3D AI character to navigate the world while following step-by-step instructions. The character follows instruction prompts combined with the spatial anchors while conversing with the user in a contextual open-ended manner. This enables a whole set of use cases from onboarding, tour guides, companion characters, tutor characters, and many more. Check out this demo and tutorial on how to build this in Unity. We are also releasing the sample project source code along with the tutorial to get you started.
