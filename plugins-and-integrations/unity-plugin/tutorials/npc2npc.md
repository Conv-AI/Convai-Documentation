# NPC2NPC

This Unity tutorial demonstrates how to implement NPC-to-NPC conversations in 3D virtual environments using Convai's NPC2NPC feature. This functionality enables two NPCs to engage in dynamic, low-latency dialogues on predetermined topics, while allowing players or other game entities to interrupt and interact with them. Thus, this feature can create more engaging and interactive game worlds with use cases like storytelling, tutorial sequences or quest initiation&#x20;

Check out this demo and tutorial on how to build this in Unity. We are also releasing the sample project source code along with the tutorial to get you started.
