## Integrating Convai with VR: Quick and Flexible Setup Options

Setting up Convai for Virtual Reality (VR) is easier than you might think. With just a few clicks, you can get Convai integrated directly into your VR projects.

To give users flexibility and customization options, we offer **two installation methods**:

* **Automatic Installation**
* **Manual Installation**

### **Automatic Installation**

The Automatic Installation method is ideal if you’re starting a new project and want to avoid dealing with VR packages or additional setup requirements. This method provides a fully Convai-integrated VR project right from the start, including the **Convai VR Demo Scene** for quick testing and exploration. This approach is particularly suitable for beginners.

**Note:** This installation method will modify Unity Project settings. These changes are necessary to ensure compatibility with Convai.
{% endhint %}

### **Manual Installation**

The Manual Installation method is designed for existing VR projects. With this method, you have full control over the setup, as **no project settings are modified, no demo scenes are added, and no customizations are applied**. Only Convai’s XR Unity Package will be integrated, giving you the freedom to use any VR SDKs without restrictions.
