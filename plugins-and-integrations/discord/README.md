### Overview

In this documentation, we list out the steps needed to create your own discord bot and connect that with a Convai Character and host a server for the bot to make it accessible to the users in discord.

### Let's Create a Character

Before we move on with hosting a discord bot server, let us first create our own character, to connect the bot to. Please follow the steps in the given page to easily get started with creating a simple character.

{% endcontent-ref %}

Now, that we have a character, let us move on to the next step

Convai is looking into solutions for hosting the server bot for you so that you do not have to go through the whole hassle in the above steps. We will keep on updating the docs as soon as we have some updates.
