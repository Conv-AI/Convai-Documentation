### Overview

### Integrating ConvAI with PlayCanvas

ConvAI is a powerful tool that enables developers to incorporate natural language processing (NLP) and conversational AI capabilities into their PlayCanvas projects. By following this guide, you'll learn how to seamlessly integrate ConvAI into your PlayCanvas project, allowing you to create engaging and interactive experiences for your users.

To help you get started, we've created a reference PlayCanvas project that demonstrates the integration of ConvAI. This project serves as a foundation for you to build upon and understand the necessary steps to incorporate ConvAI into your own projects.
