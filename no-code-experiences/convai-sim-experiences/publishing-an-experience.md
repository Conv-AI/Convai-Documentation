# Publishing an Experience

## **Make Your Experience Live**

Once youâ€™ve finished building your AI simulation or virtual tour, Convai Sim makes it easy to publish and share your experience across platforms.

## Publishing Steps

### **1. Finalizing Your Experience**

Fill in the necessary details to define and present your simulation:

* **Experience Name**\
  e.g., _Virtual Tour of the Fire Station_
* **Experience Description**\
  e.g., _Get a deeper look and understanding of the inner workings of a fire station with your virtual tour guide Lina!_
* **Thumbnail (Optional)**\
  Upload an image to visually represent your experience.

### 2. Choose Visibility Settings

Select how and with whom the experience should be shared:

* **Public**
  * Visible to everyone
  * Accessible on [**x.convai.com**](https://x.convai.com)
* **Private**
  * Only visible to you and invited users
* **Unlisted**
  * Not listed publicly, but can be accessed via a direct link
* **Embed on Your Site** _(Enterprise-only)_
  * Publish your experience directly to your own website

## **What Happens After Publishing?**

Once published, your experience becomes:

* **Accessible** to your intended audience
* **Ready for interaction** via web, kiosk, or internal use
* **Shareable** as a training tool, educational demo, or digital showcase

Whether you're running a public-facing simulation or a private module for internal teams, **Convai Sim gives you complete control** over how your AI-driven experience is distributed.
