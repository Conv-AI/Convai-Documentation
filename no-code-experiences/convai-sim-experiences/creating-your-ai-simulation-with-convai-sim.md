# Creating Your AI Simulation with Convai Sim

## Introduction

Now that you’ve created a Convai character, it’s time to place them into a 3D simulation. With Convai Sim, you can bring characters to life inside immersive environments—fully interactive and embodied in high-quality avatars.

## **Getting Started**

Follow this step-by-step guide to launch your first AI-powered simulation using Convai Sim.

### **1. Access the Playground**

Go to [**convai.com**](https://www.convai.com) and log into your account. Navigate to the **Playground** section from the dashboard.

### 2. Create a New Experience

Click on **“Create a new experience”** to begin setting up your simulation.

### **3. Choose an Environment**

Select an environment that fits your use case (e.g., office, museum, sci-fi room). Then click **“Start Experience”** to enter the Convai Sim.

### **4. Explore the Scene**

Once the scene loads:

* Use **WASD keys** to move around.
* Use your **mouse** to look around the environment — just like in a first-person game.

### **5. Add an Avatar**

Click the **top-left icon** to open the avatar menu. Then:

* Click **“Add Avatar”**.
* A hologram will appear — place it at the desired location in the scene.

### **6. Select Your Character and Avatar**

You’ll be prompted to:

* Choose your previously created **Convai character**.
* Select a **Metahuman avatar** to visually represent that character.

### **7. Deploy the Character**

Click **“Deploy Character”** to spawn the avatar into the environment. The avatar will now be active and ready to interact.

### **8. Add More Avatars (Optional)**

Repeat the process to add **multiple characters** into the same scene and create more dynamic simulations.

## Summary

You’ve now:

* Created a Convai character
* Selected a 3D environment
* Embodied your character in a lifelike avatar
* Brought them into an interactive simulation

With **multi-avatar support**, you can quickly build rich, AI-driven experiences—from training simulations and virtual tours to interactive stories and games.

Next, we’ll explore how to **customize your avatars and scenes** using the available tools.
