## **Publishing Steps**

### 1. Go to the **Publish** tab inside your character’s dashboard.

### **2. Finalizing Your Experience**

Fill in the necessary details to define and present your simulation:

* **Experience Name**\
  e.g., _Virtual Tour of the Fire Station_
* **Experience Description**\
  e.g., _Get a deeper look and understanding of the inner workings of a fire station with your virtual tour guide Lina!_
* **Thumbnail (Optional)**\
  Upload an image to visually represent your experience.

### 3. Choose Visibility Settings

Select how and with whom the experience should be shared:

* **Public**
  * Visible to everyone
  * Accessible on [**x.convai.com**](https://x.convai.com)
* **Private**
  * Only visible to you and invited users
* **Unlisted**
  * Not listed publicly, but can be accessed via a direct link
* **Embed on Your Site** _(Enterprise-only)_
  * Publish your experience directly to your own website
