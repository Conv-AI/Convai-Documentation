# Customizing Your Avatar

## **Overview**

Once your character is created, you can start customizing how they look, move, and interact using the **Avatar Studio**.

## What You Can Customize

Here’s what you can do inside the Avatar Studio:

*   **Choose a Sample Avatar,**

    Pick from a library of ready-to-use, high-fidelity avatars.
* **Customize Appearance**\
  Modify facial features, clothing, hairstyles, and other visual elements to reflect your character’s identity.
* **Upload Your Own Avatars**\
  Prefer a unique design? Upload your own 3D avatar models for full control over their look.
* **Set Up Intelligent Animations**\
  Configure gestures like waving, nodding, reacting, and thinking — all triggered contextually during conversations.
* **Select a Virtual Environment**\
  Place your avatar in immersive digital scenes that match the tone and use case of your experience.
* **Adjust Interaction Behavior**\
  Fine-tune how your avatar communicates — such as their speaking style, tone, and user engagement preferences.
* **Device & Branding Adaptation**\
  Customize how the avatar interface behaves across different devices and align it with your brand’s visual identity.

After you finish customizing, simply **save and publish** your avatar to bring it into your character’s conversations.
