# Memory

Memory section allows you to view your previous conversations with the character, organized by date and time. Each chat session is assigned a unique ID for easy reference. You can download and copy individual chat logs from the character's memory as needed.

**Enabling Long-Term Memory**

For an even more immersive experience, you can enable the Long-Term Memory feature in the Memory Settings. This allows the character to remember details about you, the player, fostering deeper, personalized relationships over time. With Long-Term Memory enabled, characters can recall your preferences and choices, adapting their responses to your individual playstyle for a truly unique experience.
