# Language and Speech

### **Set Language**

This section enables you to choose languages and voice settings for your character.

**Multilingual Support  :** Addressing global language diversity, this multilingual feature enables widespread adoption of human-like AI systems for games and digital human applications.

You can use the language field to set up-to four different languages that your character can speak. These choices define the languages that the character can speak and does not affect the input language from the user. Currently convey supports the following languages: Arabic, Chinese (Cantonese), Chinese (Mandarin), Dutch, Dutch (Belgium), English, Finnish, French, German, Hindi, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese (Brazil), Portuguese (Portugal), Russian, Spanish, Spanish (Mexico), Spanish (US), Swedish, Turkish, and Vietnamese.

### Custom Pronunciations

Custom Pronunciations enhances the **pronunciation capabilities** of the character**.** It allows you to specify how certain words should be pronounced. This can be useful for words the character may struggle with or pronounce incorrectly.&#x20;

To use this feature, add the word you want to specify in the "Word" column. Then, in the "Pronunciation" column, spell out how the word should sound using plain English letters and syllables.

For example, let's try the name "convai":

* Spelled As: convai
* Pronounced As: convey

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note that entries in the Custom Pronunciations table are **case-sensitive**. This gives you control over pronunciations, allowing you to specify different pronunciations for capitalized and non-capitalized versions of the same word if needed.

### New Word Recognition

The New Word Recognition feature enhances the **character's speech recognition capabilities**, allowing it to better understand unique or challenging words.

To use this feature, simply enter the word you want the system to learn in the "Spelled As" column. Then, in the corresponding "Pronounced As" column, spell out the word's pronunciation using easy-to-read syllables and sounds.

For example, let's try the name "Ankur":

* Spelled As: Ankur
* Pronounced As: Ahnkur
