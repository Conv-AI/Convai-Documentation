# State Of Mind

## Introduction

The **State of Mind** section provides a visual representation of your AI character’s current emotional state. This dynamic emotional map helps you understand how your character is responding internally during a conversation, allowing for fine-tuning of its personality and interaction style.

## How It Works

* The State of Mind interface displays a **color-coded emotion wheel**.
* Each segment represents a specific emotion such as **Joy, Anger, Trust, Fear, Surprise, Sadness, Disgust,** and **Anticipation**, along with nuanced variations like **Serenity, Rage, Admiration,** and **Amazement**.
* **Active emotions** — those the character is currently experiencing — are highlighted more brightly on the graph.
* Emotions change dynamically based on the context, tone, and content of the conversation.

* **Personality Tuning:** Adjust personality traits in the **Personality Traits** section and see how they influence emotional patterns.
* **Storytelling & Roleplay:** Ensure emotional consistency in interactive narratives.
