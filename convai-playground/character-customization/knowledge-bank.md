# Knowledge Bank

## Introduction

The **Knowledge Bank** is where you store and manage information that your AI character can access during conversations. By uploading documents or adding text directly, you can give your character specific domain knowledge, enabling more accurate, relevant, and context-aware responses.

All files uploaded to your Knowledge Bank are linked to your Convai account and can be connected to any of your characters. This makes it an essential tool for training characters to respond with company-specific, product-specific, or topic-specific information.

## Using the Knowledge Bank with Your Character

### Example

We uploaded a file named **Employee Onboarding Guide.txt** with the following content:

```
This document provides step-by-step guidance for new hires.
Complete HR documentation within the first 3 days of joining.
Attend the mandatory orientation session.
Set up company email and access credentials via IT Support.
Review the Code of Conduct and Data Privacy Policy.
```

### Testing Without Connecting the File

* Open the **Chatbox**.
* Ask: _“I’m a new hire. What should I do during my first week here?”_
* Result: The character responds using its general personality and AI model knowledge, not the uploaded file.

### Testing by Connecting the File

* Go to **Knowledge Bank** → **My Documents**.
* Click **Connect** on the file.
* In the Chatbox, click **Reset Chat** (top left) to start a new session.
* Ask the same question again.

**Result:** This time, the character’s response is based on the exact steps provided in the **Employee Onboarding Guide** file.
