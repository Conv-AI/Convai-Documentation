# Memory

## Introduction

The Memory section lets you review conversation history for a character and decide whether it should remember information between sessions. Use it to audit interactions, troubleshoot issues, and enable persistent preferences.

## Recent Memory

This tab lists all previous sessions with your character.\
For each session, you can view:

* **Date** – The date when the session occurred.
* **Time** – The session’s start time, shown in UTC time zone.
* **Session ID** – A unique identifier for that session.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you experience any issues in a session, support team may request the Session ID so they can investigate in detail.
{% endhint %}

**Available Actions:**

* **View conversation:** Click the downward arrow to expand and see the conversation log for that session.

## Memory Settings

This tab allows you to enable or disable **Long Term Memory**.

When Long Term Memory is **enabled**, your character can remember preferences, choices, and facts from previous sessions. For example:\
If you tell your character “My favorite color is blue” in one session, and later in a different session ask “What’s my favorite color?”, the character will respond with “blue.”

When disabled, the character will not retain information between sessions.

## Conclusion

The Memory feature provides powerful control over how your character interacts with you over time. Use Recent Memory to inspect and share specific sessions, and adjust Memory Settings to decide whether your character should retain knowledge across conversations.
