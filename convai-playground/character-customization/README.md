# Character Customization

## Introduction

The **Character Customization** section in Convai Playground is where you transform a basic AI character into a fully realized persona. Here, you’ll define how your character looks, speaks, thinks, remembers, and responds, ensuring a unique and immersive experience for your users. Each page in this section focuses on a specific customization area, allowing you to work step-by-step or revisit any aspect at any time.

## Best Practices
