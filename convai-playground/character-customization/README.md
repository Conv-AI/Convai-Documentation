# Character Customization

## Introduction

The **Character Customization** section in Convai Playground is where you transform a basic AI character into a fully realized persona. Here, you’ll define how your character looks, speaks, thinks, remembers, and responds, ensuring a unique and immersive experience for your users. Each page in this section focuses on a specific customization area, allowing you to work step-by-step or revisit any aspect at any time.

## Best Practices

* Start with core identity settings (Character Description, Language and Speech) before moving to advanced customization.
* Use **Update** frequently to save progress and avoid losing changes.
* Test your character regularly to ensure each customization change has the desired effect.
