# Global Character Controls

## Introduction

This page explains the shared controls that appear at the top right of every character page in Convai Playground. You will see the same toolbar on Character Description, Avatar, Language and Speech, Knowledge Bank, Personality Traits, Core AI Settings, State of Mind, Embodied Actions, Narrative Design, External API, Publish, and Memory. Understanding these controls helps you work faster and avoid losing changes.

***

## Where to find these controls

Look at the top right of any character screen. You will see:

* **Versioning** icon
* **Update** button
* **Character Settings** menu (three dots)

These controls behave the same way on every page.

## Controls overview

### 1. Character Versioning

Use Versioning to save and switch between alternative definitions of your character.

* **What it does**
  * Saves a named snapshot of your character definition so you can test new ideas without losing a preferred setup.
  * Lets you switch to any saved version and continue editing from there.
* **Typical uses**
  * Keep a stable production version while experimenting with a new Core Description or personality.
  * Prepare variations for different audiences or channels.
* **Good practice**
  * Give versions clear names and short notes such as “v1.2 retail tone” or “v2.0 multi language test”.
  * Save a version before major edits or before handing the character to a teammate.

For more information, refer to the [Character Versioning](character-versioning.md) documentation.

### 2. Update button

Apply your unsaved changes to the character.

*   **States**

    * **Green**: there are unsaved edits. Click **Update** to save.

    * **Gray**: everything is already saved.

* **Important**
  * If you refresh or navigate away while the button is green, your unsaved changes will be lost.
  * Click **Update** after edits on any tab, then proceed to testing.

### 3. Character Settings Menu

Open the three dots menu to access actions that affect the entire character.

#### **Clone Character**

Create a duplicate so you can branch work safely.

* **What is copied**: all character configuration tabs (e.g., Description, Personality, Languages, etc.) are copied, except the Memory tab.
* **What changes**: the clone receives a new Character ID.
* **When to use**: large experiments, staging vs production split, A or B variants.

#### **Share Character**

Let others **test** your character.

* **What it does:** Generates a share link so recipients can interact with the character (e.g., Chatbox or video call) without being able to modify it.
* **How it works:** Open the dialog to copy a share link, respecting your current visibility setting (Public, Unlisted, or Private).

#### **Delete Character**

Remove the character from your characters.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Deletion is permanent and cannot be undone.
{% endhint %}

* **Checklist before deletion**
  * Confirm the character is not used in any live experience.
  * Export or copy any content you may need.
  * Consider cloning for archival instead of deleting.
