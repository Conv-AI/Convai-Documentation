# Creating a New Character

## Introduction

The Convai Playground allows you to design AI-powered characters with unique personalities, voices, and visual appearances. This guide will walk you through creating a new character, from initial setup to customization of avatar, voice, and languages.



## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Access the Creation Tool

* From your **Dashboard**, click **Create a new character** in the top-right corner.

* A new character creation interface will open.
* In the left menu, only **Character Description**, **Avatar**, and **Voice And Languages** are active initially. Other sections will unlock after the character is created.

### 2. Character Description

* **Character’s Name** – Enter the name for your character (you can edit this later).
* **Core Description** – Write a short background covering the character’s story, personality traits, and distinctive features.
  * Alternatively, click **Generate Core Description** to create one automatically.
* **Speaking Style** _(optional)_ – Define the way your character speaks, including tone and mannerisms.
* **Visibility Settings** – Choose who can interact with your character:
  * **Public** – Available to anyone on `x.convai.com`.
  * **Unlisted** _(default)_ – Only accessible via a direct link.
  * **Private** – Restricted to you and invited users.

### 3. Avatar Customization

* Click the **Avatar** tab in the left menu.
* Select **Configure Avatar** to customize your character’s visual appearance.
* Follow the steps in the [**Avatar Studio Documentation**](../../no-code-experiences/avatar-studio-experiences/) to adjust facial features, clothing, and other design elements.
* Click **Save Changes** when done.

***

### 4. Voice and Language Settings

* Click the **Voice And Languages** tab.
* In **Language**, select one or more languages your character can speak.
* In **Voice**, choose from the filtered voice options for your selected languages.

### 5. Finalizing Character Creation

* Once all desired settings are configured, click **Create Character** at the bottom right.
* If you skip customization, a **random avatar** and **voice** will be assigned automatically.
* If you don't choose any language, **English** will be selected by default.
* You can update any attribute later, so there’s no need to finalize all decisions immediately.

## After Creation

When the character is created, additional sections in the left menu become available for deeper customization:

* Character Description
* Avatar
* Language and Speech
* Knowledge Bank
* Personality Traits
* Core AI Settings
* State of Mind
* Narrative Design
* External API
* Publish
* Memory

Each of these features allows you to enhance and refine your character for more natural, intelligent, and engaging interactions. These are covered in separate documentation.
