# Creating a New Character

## Introduction

The Convai Playground allows you to design AI-powered characters with unique personalities, voices, and visual appearances. This guide will walk you through creating a new character, from initial setup to customization of avatar, voice, and languages.



## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Access the Creation Tool

* From your **Dashboard**, click **Create a new character** in the top-right corner.

* A new character creation interface will open.
* In the left menu, only **Character Description**, **Avatar**, and **Voice And Languages** are active initially. Other sections will unlock after the character is created.

### 2. Character Description

* **Character’s Name** – Enter the name for your character (you can edit this later).
* **Core Description** – Write a short background covering the character’s story, personality traits, and distinctive features.
  * Alternatively, click **Generate Core Description** to create one automatically.
* **Speaking Style** _(optional)_ – Define the way your character speaks, including tone and mannerisms.
* **Visibility Settings** – Choose who can interact with your character:
  * **Public** – Available to anyone on `x.convai.com`.
  * **Unlisted** _(default)_ – Only accessible via a direct link.
  * **Private** – Restricted to you and invited users.

### 3. Avatar Customization

* Click the **Avatar** tab in the left menu.
* Select **Configure Avatar** to customize your character’s visual appearance.
* Follow the steps in the [**Avatar Studio Documentation**](../../no-code-experiences/avatar-studio-experiences/) to adjust facial features, clothing, and other design elements.
* Click **Save Changes** when done.

***

### 4. Voice and Language Settings

* Click the **Voice And Languages** tab.
* In **Language**, select one or more languages your character can speak.
* In **Voice**, choose from the filtered voice options for your selected languages.

### 5. Finalizing Character Creation

* Once all desired settings are configured, click **Create Character** at the bottom right.
* If you skip customization, a **random avatar** and **voice** will be assigned automatically.
* If you don't choose any language, **English** will be selected by default.
* You can update any attribute later, so there’s no need to finalize all decisions immediately.

## After Creation

When the character is created, additional sections in the left menu become available for deeper customization:

* Character Description
* Avatar
* Language and Speech
* Knowledge Bank
* Personality Traits
* Core AI Settings
* State of Mind
* Narrative Design
* External API
* Publish
* Memory

Each of these features allows you to enhance and refine your character for more natural, intelligent, and engaging interactions. These are covered in separate documentation.

The character creation process in Convai Playground is designed for flexibility — you can launch a character in minutes or spend time refining every detail. Whether you start with default settings or fully customize the avatar, voice, and description.
