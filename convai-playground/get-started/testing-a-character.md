# Testing a Character

## Introduction

Once you have created a character, it’s important to test how it interacts. Convai provides multiple ways to test your characters — from quick text and voice interactions to fully immersive video calls with custom avatars. This ensures you can refine personality, responsiveness, and interaction style before final deployment.

## Testing Options

### 1. Quick Test with Chatbox

If you want to test your character quickly without an avatar visual, you can use the **Chatbox** for text and voice interactions.

* From your **Dashboard**, click on the character you want to test.
* In the **bottom-right Chatbox**:
  * Type a message in the text input and press enter.
  * Or click the **microphone button**, speak, and click the microphone button again when finished to send your voice input.
* Continue the conversation to evaluate your character’s responses.

**Additional Chatbox Features:**

* **Conversation Starters:** At the bottom of the Chatbox, you’ll see dynamically generated conversation starters and quick replies, tailored to the ongoing dialogue.
* **Reset Chat:** Located at the top-left of the Chatbox, this button restarts the session.
* **Copy Chat:** Found directly below the Reset Chat button, it allows you to copy the conversation text.
* **Temporary Username:** The bottom-most button lets you set a temporary username.
* **Feedback Buttons:** On the right side of each character response, you’ll see thumbs-up and thumbs-down icons to provide positive or negative feedback about the reply.

### **2. Video Call**

You can test your character in a **video call** for both visual and voice interactions.\
You have two ways to start a video call:

**From the Dashboard:**

* Locate the character’s card.
* Click the **green camera icon** to start a video call instantly.

* In the top-right section, under the character’s thumbnail, click the **video call button**.

This method allows you to experience both the character’s **visual appearance** and **voice** in real-time, offering a more immersive test environment.
