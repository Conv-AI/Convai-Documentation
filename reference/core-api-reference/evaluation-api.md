#### Example prompt

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```json
You are an human analyst designated to evaluate employee-customer interactions in a given scenario. Based on the conversation transcript provided below, analyze the interaction and provide an evaluation according to the specified attributes. Each attribute should be rated on a scale of Excellent, Good, Fair, or Needs Improvement. Provide specific examples from the transcript to support your rating. Return the evaluation results in a structured JSON format for easy parsing.
Transcript:
[[conversation_history]]


Here are some data that might be needed to evaluate the conversations:
Actual Order: [[item_details]]
Customer Name: [[customer_name]]
Customer Age: [[customer_age]]


Please evaluate the above conversation based on the attributes listed and provide a Rating and Feedback for each of them. If an attribute is not applicable or cannot be assessed, return null in the json output. Return the result in the following format:


{
  "evaluation": {
    "correctness_of_responses": {
      "rating": "",
      "feedback": "[Did the employee place the actual order correctly based on the customer's request?]"
    },
    "clarity_of_responses": {
      "rating": "]",
      "feedback": "[Did the employee's responses appear clear and easy to understand based on the text provided?]"
    },
    "conciseness_and_relevance": {
      "rating": "",
      "feedback": "[Were the employeeâ€™s responses concise and focused on the relevant details, without unnecessary information?]"
    },
    "courtesy_and_respect": {
      "rating": "",
      "feedback": "[Did the employee demonstrate politeness and respect toward the customer in their language and responses?]"
    },
    "listening_skills": {
      "rating": "",
      "feedback": "[Did the employee respond appropriately, indicating they were actively listening and addressing customer concerns?]"
    },
    "product_knowledge": {
      "rating": "",
      "feedback": "[Did the employee demonstrate accurate knowledge of the menu, promotions, or policies?]"
    },
    "problem_solving_and_issue_resolution": {
      "rating": "",
      "feedback": "[Evaluate how well the employee addressed and resolved issues]"
    },
    "response_time": {
      "rating": "",
      "feedback": "[Analyze the flow of the conversation and whether there were any delays in response]"
    },
    "order_accuracy": {
      "rating": "",
      "feedback": "[Evaluate the accuracy of order confirmation, if applicable]"
    },
    "follow_up_and_conversation_closure": {
      "rating": "",
      "feedback": "[Review how the conversation was closed and whether appropriate follow-up occurred]"
    },
    "overall_summary": {
      "overall_rating": "",

    }
  }
}
```
{% endcode %}

{% hint style="info" %}
If you focus on the prompt, there are certain text within `[[ ]]` . These are `expected-variables`. Now, `[[conversation_history]]` is a compulsory expected-variable, that has to be present in the prompt. The rest of them depends on your requirements, to be passed to the prompt as needed.

So the `variables` key, in the body of the request, should be of length `expected-variables - 1`, i.e, there should be values for all the other keys mentioned in the `[[ ]]` brackets, except for `conversation_history` which is fetched from the `session_id` provided. The `variables` list can be empty if you are passing no other `expected-variables`  in the prompt.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
Not passing the `conversation_history` variable in the prompt will lead to 500 error response from the server.
