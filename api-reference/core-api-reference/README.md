# Core API Reference

This section provides a detailed overview of Convai’s **Core APIs**, which serve as the foundation for building intelligent and interactive virtual characters. The Core APIs are divided into two main categories: **Character Crafting APIs** and **Interaction APIs**, each serving a distinct purpose in your development workflow.

### Understanding the Core API

Convai’s Core API empowers developers to **create, customize, and deploy AI-driven characters** across various use cases — from immersive games to virtual assistants.

The Core API is structured into two segments:

[character-crafting-apis](character-crafting-apis/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="interaction-apis/" %}
[interaction-apis](interaction-apis/)
{% endcontent-ref %}
