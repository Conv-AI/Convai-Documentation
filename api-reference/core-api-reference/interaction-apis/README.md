  APIs for natural text and voice-based communication.

# Interaction APIs

The **Interaction APIs** enable real-time, dynamic interaction between users and your AI characters.\
Once your characters are live, these APIs handle conversational input and contextual responses.

With these APIs, you can:

* **Engage in live conversations** — send user text or voice inputs and receive contextual, natural replies.
* **Retrieve responses in text and/or audio form**, enabling both text-based chat and voice dialogue modes.
* **Send and process audio input** (e.g., `.wav` mono files with supported sample rates) to enable real-time speech recognition.

The Interaction APIs bridge your characters and users, enabling seamless, responsive communication across both textual and voice channels.
