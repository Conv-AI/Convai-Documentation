# Tour Guide

## **Introduction**

In this guide, you'll learn how to bring your AI avatars to life by turning them into dynamic tour guides within immersive 3D environments.

We’ll walk you through how to:

* Set up a tour-guide simulation
* Define interaction behaviors
* Add tour points
* Manage the tour flow
* Preview and publish the experience

## Step by Step Guide

### **1. Setting Up Tour Guide Mode**

1. Select your avatar to open the **Edit & Publish** menu.
2. Locate the **Tour Planner Settings** section.
3. Set up your **Tour Prompts** – these define what the avatar says at the start and end of the tour.

**Example Prompts:**

* **Welcome Prompt:**\
  “Hi there! Ready to explore the fire station?”\
  → Greet the user, introduce yourself, and invite them to start the tour.
* **End Prompt:**\
  “That’s the end of the tour. Hope you had fun!”\
  → Ask if the user has any questions, answer them, then say goodbye.

### **2. Defining Behavior**

Choose how your avatar initiates the tour:

* **Wait for Player:**\
  Avatar stays still and waits until the user approaches.
* **Engage on Sight:**\
  Avatar detects the user visually and initiates conversation.
* **Max (Timed Engagement):**\
  Avatar starts interacting after a set period of user inactivity.

### **3. Adding Tour Points**

1. Click **“Add Tour Point”** — a green gizmo will appear in the scene.
2. Use the **XYZ axes** or click the **flag icon** to position the tour marker.
3. Enter a **Tour Point Name** (e.g., “Fire Truck”).
4. Add an **Objective** describing what the avatar will explain or do at this point (e.g., “Describe the fire truck and its role in emergencies.”).
5. Repeat this process to build a full tour path.

### **4. Managing the Tour**
