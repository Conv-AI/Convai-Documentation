## **Bring Your Character to Life with the Right Setting**

Selecting an environment helps anchor your avatar in a scene that matches your use case — whether it’s professional, playful, or futuristic.

You can choose from a variety of **immersive 3D and Solid environments**, including:

* A sleek, **modern office**
* A **sci-fi room** with futuristic vibes
* A warm and inviting **cozy lounge**
* A minimal and practical **kiosk-style backdrop**

These environments serve as the **visual context** for your avatar’s interactions, making conversations feel more realistic and engaging for your audience.

{% hint style="success" %}
Match the environment with the personality or purpose of your character — for example, use a sci-fi room for a space-themed NPC, or a lounge for a friendly assistant.
{% endhint %}
