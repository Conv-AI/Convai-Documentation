# Configure Avatar

Once you enter the **Avatar Studio**, you can define exactly how your avatar looks and behaves. Here’s how to get started:

## **Choosing a Sample Avatar**

You can start by selecting a high-quality **sample Metahuman avatar** from Convai’s library. These are designed to cover a wide range of character types and use cases.

* Browse the available avatars by scrolling through the list.
* Click on the one you want to use.
* That avatar will be instantly applied to your character.

If you want something more unique, you can create a custom avatar using the built-in editor.

1. Go to the **“Craft your own”** tab.
2. Click the **plus icon (+)** to start creating a new custom avatar.
3. Give your avatar a **name**.
4. Customize features such as:
   * **Facial features**
   * **Hairstyle & hair color**
   * **Skin tone & texture**
   * **Outfits & accessories**
   * **Age appearance**
5. Under the **“Brand”** section:
   * Use sliders to apply your logo on supported clothing items.
   * Make sure **“Display logo on cloth”** is enabled under Interface Settings.

This allows for highly personalized avatars that align with your branding and narrative needs.
