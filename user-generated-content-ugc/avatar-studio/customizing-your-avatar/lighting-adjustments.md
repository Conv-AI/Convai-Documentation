## Set the Right Mood with Lighting

Lighting plays a key role in how your avatar looks and feels within the environment. It affects not only visibility, but also the overall **tone and atmosphere** of the scene.

Here’s how you can adjust lighting for your avatar:

* **Choose a Lighting Preset**\
  Use the dropdown menu to select from several **preset lighting setups.**
* **Adjust Lighting Power**\
  Use the **power level slider** to fine-tune the light.
