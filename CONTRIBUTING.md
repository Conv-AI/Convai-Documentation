### 4.1 Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that is easy to read and write. To ensure consistency and clarity in our documentation, please follow these guidelines when using Markdown.

Use * or _ for emphasis. For example:

```
*italic* or _italic_
**bold** or __bold__
```

Use - or * for unordered lists and numbers for ordered lists. For example:

```
- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Subitem A
  - Subitem B
  
1. First item
2. Second item
```
   
4.1.4. Links
Use [text](URL) for links. For example:

```

```

4.1.5. Images
Use ![alt text](imageURL) for images. For example:

```
![Logo](images/logo.png)
```

4.1.6. Code
